Title: "Nonlinear Equations Solvers: Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Fixed Point Iteration, and Newton's Method with Multiple Roots"

Description:
This GitHub repository showcases various methods for solving nonlinear equations, offering a collection of solvers including Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant, Fixed Point Iteration, and Newton's Method with Multiple Roots. These numerical techniques provide versatile and efficient approaches to finding solutions for nonlinear equations and empower users with a comprehensive toolkit for solving complex mathematical problems.

Key Features:
1. Bisection Solver: The repository includes an implementation of the Bisection method, a reliable and robust algorithm for finding roots of a continuous function within a given interval. The Bisection method utilizes interval halving and provides an iterative approach to narrow down the search interval until the root is sufficiently approximated. It is especially useful for functions with a single root within the interval.

2. Newton-Raphson Solver: The repository features an implementation of the Newton-Raphson method, a powerful iterative technique that uses the derivative of the function to approximate the root. The method starts with an initial guess and updates it using the tangent line to iteratively converge to the root. The Newton-Raphson method is known for its rapid convergence and efficiency, making it suitable for functions with a known derivative.

3. Secant Solver: The repository provides an implementation of the Secant method, which is a variant of the Newton-Raphson method that approximates the derivative using finite differences. The Secant method does not require the evaluation of the derivative at each iteration, making it more flexible for cases where the derivative is not readily available or difficult to compute. It offers an effective alternative to the Newton-Raphson method.

4. Fixed Point Iteration Solver: The repository includes an implementation of the Fixed Point Iteration method, which transforms a nonlinear equation into a fixed point equation and iteratively finds the root by updating the initial guess. This method is widely used when the nonlinear equation can be written in the form of x = g(x), where g(x) is a continuous function. The Fixed Point Iteration method provides simplicity and ease of implementation for certain classes of equations.

5. Newton's Method with Multiple Roots: The repository offers an extension to Newton's Method for handling multiple roots of a nonlinear equation. It incorporates techniques such as root shifting and bracketing to ensure convergence to the desired root. This enhancement enables users to find multiple roots efficiently and accurately, expanding the applicability of Newton's Method to a wider range of problems.

6. Performance Comparison and Analysis: The repository provides a comparative analysis of the solvers, evaluating their convergence behavior, accuracy, computational efficiency, and stability for various types of nonlinear equations. The analysis helps users understand the strengths and limitations of each method, allowing them to select the most appropriate solver based on the characteristics of their specific problem.

7. Documentation and Usage: The repository offers comprehensive documentation, code comments, and markdown files that explain the theoretical foundations, equations, and implementation details of each solver. It provides clear instructions on how to use the solvers, including input requirements, usage examples, and customization options. Users can easily incorporate these solvers into their projects, modify them to suit their needs, and explore different combinations for optimal results.
